BUGS
  
  to upload or download files this extension use the koFileEx object, instead of reusing the current connection from koRemoteConnectionService. There is a writeFile method but I don't know how to use it. Any hint?

  looks like there is no chance to use 8bits into folders or files names?? when creating a folder with filezilla called "Русский" the folder gets created, when trying with koRemoteConnectionService I get a folder created with name: "???????"
  	
  the tree refresh is incomplete.
  
  probably others.
