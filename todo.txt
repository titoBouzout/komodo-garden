the tree refresh is incomplete.

escribir todos los prompts personalizados con ícono y título
en los dialogos de sobre escribir el icono para remote diferente a local

olvidar la seleccion cuando se remueven o mueven elementos del tree

BUGS

0) the tree refresh is not done yet

1) looks like there is no chance to use 8bits into folders or files names?? when creating a folder with filezilla called "Русский" the folder gets created, when trying with koRemoteConnectionService I get a folder created with name: "???????". I want to give the option to use utf8.
  
2) overwrite prompts are crazy, no file is overwriten if "no", "cancel" or "no to all" is selected, but functions "yes to all" or "no to all" ask many times the same thing..

2.1) the overwrite function looks for the files in the server instead of comparing the modifiedtime and size

3) there is no queue of files yet.. wait what!?
