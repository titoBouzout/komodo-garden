BUGS

  1) I dont know how to tell to koRemoteConnectionService to use 8bits on the connection, for example,  when creating a folder with filezilla called "Русский" the folder gets created, when trying with koRemoteConnectionService I get a folder created with name: "???????". I want to give the option to use utf8.
	
  2) "overwrite prompts" are crazy, no file is overwriten if "no", "cancel" or "no to all" is selected, but functions "yes to all" or "no to all" ask many times the same thing..
  
  2.1) the overwrite function looks for the files in the server instead of comparing the modifiedtime and size
  
  3) there is no queue of files yet.. wait what!?
	
  4) when a file doenst have an extension such .html koRemoteConnectionService skips the file. This cause problems when deleting a folder: "550 Directory not empty." on windows.

  tree toolbar
	"go up button" should be a menu-button listing all parent directories
	a textbox to filter the tree content and when pressing enter real scan all the base directory

  tree
	check for "views"(specify files and directories to include or exclude)
	give option to enable or disable horizontal scrolling
	show a mark on modified not uploaded/downloaded files
	when a item is renamed from the tree: instead of removing the element and appending again we should rename the item sort that item
	getImageSrc is needed for something??
	  
  servers
	a textbox to allow "cmd remote" commmands
  
  chmod:
	show old permissions for each selected file when requesting a chmod change command
	chmod dialog should contain nice checkbox about permissino,group,owner,public,read,write,execute etc
	
  programming
  
	the data related to the tree ( is container open, etc) should be separate from the cache of the paths, then we can share betwen windows the paths without changing the folder status(collapsed/expanded) in all the windows.
	
	the tree view should be generic for any tree. when user opens a folder for example there should be something like function onContainerOpened(aContainer){ myCoolCallback(aContainer); }
